## glorybeasts
glorybeasts started in 2014 when i rescued a whole litter of pups (all 6 of them) in greece. been going back for more ever since. i'm happy to talk details over a drink or email, or you can just head over to [glorybeasts.xyz](http://glorybeasts.xyz) and have a look (english & german). <br>

sad fact: we always need money, so if you have some to spare, a donation is <b>hugely</b> appreciated! 

## HAEQS
HAEQS is a berlin-based queer feminist group of people who hack. we have some really great stuff that's waiting to be realized, and we're just getting started!<br>
more info: [haeqs.xyz](http://haeqs.xyz) or on our [twitter](https://twitter.com/HAEQSpace)

## crypto stuff!
i'll be giving some workshop for feminist hack&art spaces in the fall (on web & feminism), and HAEQS has plans to have some regular crypto-centered meetings. i collect any and all resources, so let me know when you come across ineresting material!

## job hunt
do you know that pesky difference between working and getting paid for your work? 'm doing a lot of the former, and need to be doing more of the latter: so i'm looking for something that will pay the bills! added points for being interesting/ fun/ challenging! i have a background in humanities (lit & culture) -- all coding skills are developing rn. if you hear anything... ;) 

## femme hive
femme hive is an ongoing project based in berlin, and it's all about fighting femme invisibility and celebrating queer femininity! we have yearly bigger meetings, and organise some monthly events. [femmmehive.com](http://femmehive.com) has some more info, and our [FB page](https://facebook.com/femmehive) is where we are most active. there's also a twitter at [@femmehive](https://twitter.com/femmehive). (if i have some time this summer i'll give the website an overhaul ;) )
