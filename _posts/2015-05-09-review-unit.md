title: review - unit, a so-called queer festival
tags: [blog]
---

so i went to berlin's first queer tech festival, hoping it would be amazing. sadly, as often happens when we hope for something awesome, we get disappointed. 

there were a number of problems with unit, besides the content (which i found to be apolitical, geared towards an unquestioning, consumerist culture, and generally in step with queer capitalist hedonism):<br>
- having bag checks at the entrance, and having security dudes present: triggering to many queer people (especially if not white_male), also excludes anyone not able to afford to buy tiny bottles of very expenive water inside (any drinks were taken away/ had to stay outside. <br>
- not paying speakers: as an organizer i know it can be hard to raise money, but equally, this is a question of priorities. having a super fancy location (a nightclub) and not paying speakers' work (or even travel cost) is evidence of skewed priorities.<br>
- a flood of free tickets after selling them first: this is just unfair to everyone. <br>
- invoking "welpenschutz" at feedback round: not only does such a thing not exist outside of immediate family (in canines), it was also very annoying to have <b>only</b> positive feedback. i get that it's all a show, but queer means being accountable and taking responsibility. also telling how ONLY positive tweets got retweeted by the official Unicorns in Tech account, but <b>NONE</b> of the critical ones. <br>

all in all, from my (white) feminine queer & political point of view, #unit lacked a political dimension that i (and others) link to queer. it would have been nice to give center stage to marginalized voices (instead of having them in a tent next to beer-jugging bros and loud music), and to encourage people to attend those sessions & gain some insight into other people's experiences. the way #unit was set up, though, it very much reproduced the existing situation. 
also, there should have been more awareness of privilege in general, from speakers and organizers alike. 

all that said, i'm torn on whether to attend again. on the one hand, i'd like to see if there will be any changes in 2016, on the other, and on the very realistic chance it will be ignored, i really dont want to seeminly show support... tricky.
